Used Python to compute a 38-body gravitational simulation of the Milky Way nuclear S-star cluster around Sagittarius A*. Used Keplerian coordinates from relevant research data to transform into Cartesian position, velocity, and acceleration in AU relative to the center of the galaxy. Used light intensity data to determine the mass of each star and calculated orbital paths over the course of a 100 years starting from 2025.
